I started my IT career in Argentina as a _mainframe developer_, working on different IBM platforms at **Banco de Accion Social**, a financial institution where I became **Lead Developer** and **Project Manager**. In 1992 I graduated as **Systems Analyst**, with an _Associate degree_ in **Computer Science**, and started my own business, a computer store, and later a Professional Training Center. For many years I worked also as an **ESL teacher** and **Professor** in **Technology** and **Programming Languages**. In 2004 I moved to Spain where I performed as a technician and consultant for local IT companies until 2008, when I **moved to the US**. In 2009 I started working for **_Vesta Corporation_**, a _payment processing company_, where I performed public-facing roles prior to being promoted in 2013 to their corporate division as a **QA-Tester**. After going through intensive self-training in _Software Testing with Automation_, I also held roles as **QA Engineer**, and **System Transition Engineer**.\
\
For the last 10+ years I held roles as **Quality Assurance / Quality Engineer** and **DevOps**, twice as a contractor for **_Nike_**, during the second providing also services as _Developer_ in one of their wholesale departments. Across two terms working for **_Intel_** as a contractor at their JF3 campus, during the first I performed as _Software Quality Engineer with Automation_, and as _Project Manager / Program Manager_ during the second, leading offshore teams.\
\
Back in 2020, I started working on a family project in Argentina, a _multi-cloud_, _multi-tenant_ **Retail Management System SaaS**, to be launched by the end of 2023. The stack for this project is _NextJS_, _React_, _TypeScript_, _Tailwind_, _GraphQL (Apollo Client/GraphQL Yoga Server)_, _Prisma/Grafbase_ (_ORM/GraphQL backend_), and _PostgresDB/DynamoDB_.\

I am a strong believer in continuous learning, and am always looking for new challenges to keep myself both motivated and engaged. My every-day life is driven by that genuine passion for learning, to stay as up-to-date as possible with new technologies in the fields of my interest.\
\
Aside from my IT professional life I am an enthusiast _guitar player_ and _singer_, and together with my wife as PR and agent we enjoy playing and singing at home, and sometimes at local venues in the greater PDX area. We love nature and animals, and we take every opportunity to go hiking in the beautiful Oregon outdoors.
